        <h2>Understanding Null Hypothesis Significance Testing</h2>
        <p>Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) is a fundamental concept in statistics that helps in decision-making processes. It is a method used to determine if there is enough evidence in a sample of data to infer that a certain condition is true for the entire population.</p>

        <h2>What is the Null Hypothesis?</h2>
        <p>The <strong>null hypothesis</strong> \(H_{0}\) is a general statement or default position that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena or no association among groups. For example, \(H_{0}:\mu=0\).</p>

        <h2>What is the Alternative Hypothesis?</h2>
        <p>The <strong>alternative hypothesis</strong> \(H_{1}\) or \(H_{a}\) is what you might believe to be true or hope to prove true. For instance, \(H_{1}:\mu\neq0\) in a two-tailed test.</p>

        <h2>Significance Level \(\alpha\)</h2>
        <p>The significance level \(\alpha\) is a threshold set by the researcher which defines the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. A common choice for \(\alpha\) is 0.05.</p>

        <h2>Decision Rule</h2>
        <p>If the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis. This is considered statistically significant. Conversely, if the p-value is greater than \(\alpha\), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>A test statistic is a standardized value that is calculated from sample data during a hypothesis test. It's used to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.</p>
    
    <h2>Z-Test Statistic</h2>
    <p>The Z-test statistic is used when testing hypotheses about the population mean when the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large.</p>
    <p>The formula for the Z-test statistic is:</p>
    <p>\[ Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} \]</p>
    <ul>
        <li>\( \bar{X} \) is the sample mean.</li>
        <li>\( \mu_0 \) is the hypothesized population mean under the null hypothesis.</li>
        <li>\( \sigma \) is the population standard deviation.</li>
        <li>\( n \) is the sample size.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>T-Test Statistic</h2>
    <p>The t-test statistic is used when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small.</p>
    <p>The formula for the t-test statistic is:</p>
    <p>\[ t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} \]</p>
    <ul>
        <li>\( \bar{X} \) is the sample mean.</li>
        <li>\( \mu_0 \) is the hypothesized population mean under the null hypothesis.</li>
        <li>\( s \) is the sample standard deviation.</li>
        <li>\( n \) is the sample size.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Interpreting the Test Statistic</h2>
    <p>The calculated test statistic is compared against a critical value from a statistical distribution (such as the standard normal distribution for a Z-test or the t-distribution for a t-test) to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.</p>

        <h2>Z-Test Statistic Calculation Example</h2>
        <p>Given the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Population mean (\( \mu \)): 75</li>
            <li>Sample mean (\( \bar{X} \)): 78</li>
            <li>Population standard deviation (\( \sigma \)): 5</li>
            <li>Sample size (\( n \)): 30</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We can state our hypotheses as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Null hypothesis (\( H_0 \)): \( \mu = 75 \)</li>
            <li>Alternative hypothesis (\( H_1 \)): \( \mu \neq 75 \)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The Z-test statistic is calculated using the formula:</p>
        <p>\[ Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} \]</p>
        
        <p>Plugging in the values we get:</p>
        <p>\[ Z = \frac{78 - 75}{\frac{5}{\sqrt{30}}} \]</p>
        
        <p>Calculating the Z-value gives us:</p>
        <p>\[ Z \approx 2.915 \]</p>
        
        <p>Now, we can use the Z-value to find the p-value and make a decision about our null hypothesis.</p>
        <h2>T Statistic Example</h2>
        <p>Scenario: Testing the effect of a new teaching method on student test scores.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sample size (n): 25</li>
            <li>Sample mean (\( \bar{X} \)): 82</li>
            <li>Sample standard deviation (s): 6</li>
            <li>Hypothesized population mean (\( \mu_0 \)): 80</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Calculation</h2>
        <p>The t-test statistic is calculated as:</p>
        <p>\[ t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} \]</p>
        <p>Plugging in the values, we get:</p>
        <p>\[ t = \frac{82 - 80}{\frac{6}{\sqrt{25}}} = \frac{2}{1.2} = 1.67 \]</p>
        
        <p>Now, we can use the t-statistic to find the p-value and make a decision regarding our null hypothesis.</p>

        <h2>Problem Set</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>A company claims that its employees have an average IQ of 110. A random sample of 50 employees is taken, and their average IQ is found to be 108 with a standard deviation of 15. Test at a 5% significance level whether the company's claim is accurate.</li>
            <li>A type of candy is labeled to have a weight of 120 grams. A quality control test is conducted where a sample of 100 candies is weighed, and the average weight is found to be 118 grams with a standard deviation of 10 grams. Is there evidence at a 1% significance level that the average weight of the candy is different from the labeled weight?</li>
            <li>A new teaching method is claimed to increase student performance. To test this, a sample of 20 students is selected, and their performance is evaluated. The sample mean score is 75 with a standard deviation of 8, while the historical mean score is 70. Test the effectiveness of the new teaching method at a 5% significance level.</li>
            <li>A pharmaceutical company claims that their new drug lowers blood pressure more effectively than the current standard. In a trial, 15 patients are administered the new drug, resulting in an average drop in blood pressure of 30 mm Hg with a standard deviation of 5 mm Hg. Historically, the standard drug reduces blood pressure by 25 mm Hg. Test the company's claim at a 1% significance level.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <h2>Z-Statistic Problems</h2>
        <h3>Problem 1 Solution</h3>
        <p>\[ Z = \frac{108 - 110}{\frac{15}{\sqrt{50}}} \approx -0.94 \]</p>
        <p>The Z value is -0.94. Since this is less than 1.96 (the critical value for a 5% significance level), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.</p>

        <h3>Problem 2 Solution</h3>
        <p>\[ Z = \frac{118 - 120}{\frac{10}{\sqrt{100}}} = -2 \]</p>
        <p>The Z value is -2. Since this is greater than -2.33 (the critical value for a 1% significance level), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.</p>

        <h2>T-Statistic Problems</h2>
        <h3>Problem 1 Solution</h3>
        <p>\[ t = \frac{75 - 70}{\frac{8}{\sqrt{20}}} \approx 3.54 \]</p>
        <p>The t value is 3.54. This is greater than 2.093 (the critical t-value for a 5% significance level with 19 degrees of freedom), so we reject the null hypothesis.</p>

        <h3>Problem 2 Solution</h3>
        <p>\[ t = \frac{30 - 25}{\frac{5}{\sqrt{15}}} \approx 6.16 \]</p>
        <p>The t value is 6.16. This is greater than 2.977 (the critical t-value for a 1% significance level with 14 degrees of freedom), so we reject the null hypothesis.</p>
