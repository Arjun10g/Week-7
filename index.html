        <h2>Understanding Null Hypothesis Significance Testing</h2>
        <p>Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) is a fundamental concept in statistics that helps in decision-making processes. It is a method used to determine if there is enough evidence in a sample of data to infer that a certain condition is true for the entire population.</p>

        <h2>What is the Null Hypothesis?</h2>
        <p>The <strong>null hypothesis</strong> \(H_{0}\) is a general statement or default position that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena or no association among groups. For example, \(H_{0}:\mu=0\).</p>

        <h2>What is the Alternative Hypothesis?</h2>
        <p>The <strong>alternative hypothesis</strong> \(H_{1}\) or \(H_{a}\) is what you might believe to be true or hope to prove true. For instance, \(H_{1}:\mu\neq0\) in a two-tailed test.</p>

        <h2>Significance Level \(\alpha\)</h2>
        <p>The significance level \(\alpha\) is a threshold set by the researcher which defines the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. A common choice for \(\alpha\) is 0.05.</p>

        <h2>Decision Rule</h2>
        <p>If the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis. This is considered statistically significant. Conversely, if the p-value is greater than \(\alpha\), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>A test statistic is a standardized value that is calculated from sample data during a hypothesis test. It's used to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.</p>
    
    <h2>Z-Test Statistic</h2>
    <p>The Z-test statistic is used when testing hypotheses about the population mean when the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large.</p>
    <p>The formula for the Z-test statistic is:</p>
    <p>\[ Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} \]</p>
    <ul>
        <li>\( \bar{X} \) is the sample mean.</li>
        <li>\( \mu_0 \) is the hypothesized population mean under the null hypothesis.</li>
        <li>\( \sigma \) is the population standard deviation.</li>
        <li>\( n \) is the sample size.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>T-Test Statistic</h2>
    <p>The t-test statistic is used when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small.</p>
    <p>The formula for the t-test statistic is:</p>
    <p>\[ t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} \]</p>
    <ul>
        <li>\( \bar{X} \) is the sample mean.</li>
        <li>\( \mu_0 \) is the hypothesized population mean under the null hypothesis.</li>
        <li>\( s \) is the sample standard deviation.</li>
        <li>\( n \) is the sample size.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Interpreting the Test Statistic</h2>
    <p>The calculated test statistic is compared against a critical value from a statistical distribution (such as the standard normal distribution for a Z-test or the t-distribution for a t-test) to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.</p>

        <h2>Z-Test Statistic Calculation Example</h2>
        <p>Given the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Population mean (\( \mu \)): 75</li>
            <li>Sample mean (\( \bar{X} \)): 78</li>
            <li>Population standard deviation (\( \sigma \)): 5</li>
            <li>Sample size (\( n \)): 30</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We can state our hypotheses as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Null hypothesis (\( H_0 \)): \( \mu = 75 \)</li>
            <li>Alternative hypothesis (\( H_1 \)): \( \mu \neq 75 \)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The Z-test statistic is calculated using the formula:</p>
        <p>\[ Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} \]</p>
        
        <p>Plugging in the values we get:</p>
        <p>\[ Z = \frac{78 - 75}{\frac{5}{\sqrt{30}}} \]</p>
        
        <p>Calculating the Z-value gives us:</p>
        <p>\[ Z \approx 2.915 \]</p>
        
        <p>Now, we can use the Z-value to find the p-value and make a decision about our null hypothesis.</p>
        <h2>T Statistic Example</h2>
        <p>Scenario: Testing the effect of a new teaching method on student test scores.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sample size (n): 25</li>
            <li>Sample mean (\( \bar{X} \)): 82</li>
            <li>Sample standard deviation (s): 6</li>
            <li>Hypothesized population mean (\( \mu_0 \)): 80</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Calculation</h2>
        <p>The t-test statistic is calculated as:</p>
        <p>\[ t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} \]</p>
        <p>Plugging in the values, we get:</p>
        <p>\[ t = \frac{82 - 80}{\frac{6}{\sqrt{25}}} = \frac{2}{1.2} = 1.67 \]</p>
        
        <p>Now, we can use the t-statistic to find the p-value and make a decision regarding our null hypothesis.</p>

        <h2>Problem Set</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>A company claims that its employees have an average IQ of 110. A random sample of 50 employees is taken, and their average IQ is found to be 108 with a standard deviation of 15. Test at a 5% significance level whether the company's claim is accurate.</li>
            <li>A type of candy is labeled to have a weight of 120 grams. A quality control test is conducted where a sample of 100 candies is weighed, and the average weight is found to be 118 grams with a standard deviation of 10 grams. Is there evidence at a 1% significance level that the average weight of the candy is different from the labeled weight?</li>
            <li>A new teaching method is claimed to increase student performance. To test this, a sample of 20 students is selected, and their performance is evaluated. The sample mean score is 75 with a standard deviation of 8, while the historical mean score is 70. Test the effectiveness of the new teaching method at a 5% significance level.</li>
            <li>A pharmaceutical company claims that their new drug lowers blood pressure more effectively than the current standard. In a trial, 15 patients are administered the new drug, resulting in an average drop in blood pressure of 30 mm Hg with a standard deviation of 5 mm Hg. Historically, the standard drug reduces blood pressure by 25 mm Hg. Test the company's claim at a 1% significance level.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <h2>Z-Statistic Problems</h2>
        <h3>Problem 1 Solution</h3>
        <p>\[ Z = \frac{108 - 110}{\frac{15}{\sqrt{50}}} \approx -0.94 \]</p>
        <p>The Z value is -0.94. This should be compared with the critical value for a 5% significance level to determine the hypothesis test result.</p>
        
        <h3>Problem 2 Solution</h3>
        <p>\[ Z = \frac{118 - 120}{\frac{10}{\sqrt{100}}} = -2 \]</p>
        <p>The Z value is -2. This should be compared with the critical value for a 1% significance level to determine the hypothesis test result.</p>
        
        <h2>T-Statistic Problems</h2>
        <h3>Problem 3 Solution</h3>
        <p>\[ t = \frac{75 - 70}{\frac{8}{\sqrt{20}}} \approx 2.80 \]</p>
        <p>The t value is 2.80. This should be compared with the critical t-value for a 5% significance level with 19 degrees of freedom to determine the hypothesis test result.</p>
        
        <h3>Problem 4 Solution</h3>
        <p>\[ t = \frac{30 - 25}{\frac{5}{\sqrt{15}}} \approx 3.87 \]</p>
        <p>The t value is 3.87. This should be compared with the critical t-value for a 1% significance level with 14 degrees of freedom to determine the hypothesis test result.</p>

    <h2>Sample Problem</h2>
    <p>A researcher wants to estimate the average height of adult women in a certain population. She collects a random sample of 35 women and records their heights. The average height in the sample is 165 cm, with a standard deviation of 5 cm. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the average height of adult women in this population.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Determine Sample Statistics:</strong>
            <p>Sample Mean (\( \bar{x} \)): 165 cm<br>
            Sample Standard Deviation (s): 5 cm<br>
            Sample Size (n): 35</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Choose Confidence Level:</strong>
            <p>95%</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Find the Critical Value:</strong>
            <p>For a 95% confidence level, the critical value (t) from the t-distribution table with 34 degrees of freedom (n-1) is approximately 1.96.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Calculate Margin of Error:</strong>
            <p>\( \text{Margin of Error} = t \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \) = 1.96 x \( \frac{5}{\sqrt{35}} \)</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Compute Confidence Interval:</strong>
            <p>Lower Bound = \( \bar{x} - \text{Margin of Error} \)<br>
            Upper Bound = \( \bar{x} + \text{Margin of Error} \)<br>
            Thus, the 95% confidence interval is calculated.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Extended Sample Problem</h2>
    <p>Following the previous study on the average height of adult women in a certain population, the researcher now wants to test the hypothesis that the average height of adult women in this population is different from the national average of 160 cm. She uses the same sample of 35 women, where the average height was 165 cm with a standard deviation of 5 cm. Conduct a hypothesis test at the 5% significance level and calculate the p-value.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>State the Hypotheses:</strong>
            <p>Null Hypothesis (\( H_0 \)): The average height is 160 cm (\( \mu = 160 \)).<br>
            Alternative Hypothesis (\( H_1 \)): The average height is not 160 cm (\( \mu \neq 160 \)).</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Calculate the Test Statistic:</strong>
            <p>Use the formula for the t-statistic: \( t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} \) = \( \frac{165 - 160}{\frac{5}{\sqrt{35}}} \).</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Determine the Degrees of Freedom:</strong>
            <p>Degrees of Freedom (df) = n - 1 = 35 - 1 = 34.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Calculate the p-value:</strong>
            <p>Using the calculated t-statistic and the degrees of freedom, find the p-value from the t-distribution table or a statistical software.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
            <p>If the p-value is less than 0.05 (5% significance level), reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, fail to reject the null hypothesis. The conclusion will provide insight into whether the average height significantly differs from the national average.</p>
        </li>

    <h2>Type 1 Error (False Positive)</h2>
    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> The true average height of adult women in the population is actually 160 cm, which means the null hypothesis (H0: μ = 160 cm) is true.</p>
    <p><strong>Type 1 Error:</strong> The researcher concludes that the average height is significantly different from 160 cm based on her sample, even though in reality, it's not. This error occurs if the p-value is mistakenly found to be less than the significance level (0.05), leading to the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis.</p>
    <p><strong>Consequence:</strong> The researcher incorrectly believes that the average height in the population is different from 160 cm, potentially leading to misinformed decisions or further research based on this incorrect assumption.</p>

    <h2>Type 2 Error (False Negative)</h2>
    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> The true average height of adult women in the population is different from 160 cm, which means the null hypothesis (H0: μ = 160 cm) is false.</p>
    <p><strong>Type 2 Error:</strong> The researcher concludes that there is no significant difference in the average height from 160 cm based on her sample, even though in reality, there is a difference. This error occurs if the p-value is mistakenly found to be greater than the significance level (0.05), leading to the incorrect failure to reject a false null hypothesis.</p>
    <p><strong>Consequence:</strong> The researcher fails to identify a real difference in average height, potentially missing out on important findings or implications related to the height of women in that population.</p>
